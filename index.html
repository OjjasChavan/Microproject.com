        <center><u><h1 class = "about_title">About Different countries and their Cultures</h1></u></center>
        <p class="about_para">There are currently 195 recognized countries in the world, according to the United Nations. However, this number can vary depending on how different countries are defined, as some territories are claimed by multiple countries or have disputed sovereignty. The number of countries has also changed over time, with new nations emerging and some merging or ceasing to exist.
            As for cultures, the number is difficult to quantify as culture is not easily defined or measured. Culture refers to the shared beliefs, values, customs, behaviors, and artifacts that characterize a group or society. Each country may have multiple cultures within it, based on factors such as ethnicity, religion, language, and regional differences.
            Moreover, cultures are not static and can evolve over time as societies change and interact with each other. This means that cultures can be fluid and dynamic, and there may be many subcultures within a larger cultural group. In short, the number of cultures in the world is impossible to determine precisely, but it is safe to say that there are countless variations and expressions of human culture across the globe.</p>
